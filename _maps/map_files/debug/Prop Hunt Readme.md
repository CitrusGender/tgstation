~ PropHunt Minigame.zip README.md ~

How to:

PropHunt will be hosted on z2 Minigame Room 2, the north west corner room. All arenas need to fit within 
a 13x13 map. All arenas should be made as separate .dmm files for the sake of easy sorting and working.
Naming convention is as files found, simply count up.

"What can I do?"

- Add clutter to existing maps or propose layout changes that you think work better
- Help figure out how we can hack the arena console variable to make Red/Blue team Hiders/Seekers.
- Playtest the best method for emulating prophunt (what ingame items/spells are best for disguising as a props)
- Hack the holodeck console to generate 13x13 arenas
- Make more maps
- Find a way to link status displays to a brig cell timer for easy minigame timer control and dispay across maps
